# Blimp

Inspired by the `simplon/helium`, this library uses a Guzzle service description for connecting to the Urban Airship
API. A light wrapper is placed over this service to make common tasks a bit simpler.

### Setup
Include the [composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) package:

```json
"require": {
   "phindmarsh/blimp": "dev-master"
}
```

### Anything else needed?

You'll need an Urban Airship account, and the Application Key, Secret and Master Secret.
